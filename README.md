# ðŸŽ² - Las Vegas Dice App

## Full Disclosure
This code was adapted from another repo, but it was far too outdated for me to waste time adapting it.
I ended up only using the idea and images from the previous course, everything else is mine.
I'm most likely going to keep on adding changes as an exercise in learning.


## Project Insight

This project served as an introduction to fundamental programming concepts in Flutter, laying the groundwork for future app development. It focused on creating a functional Las Vegas dice app, teaching the practical application of Stateful Flutter widgets and setState().

## Key Features Developed

- **Interactive Dice Rolling:** A button-activated dice roll simulates a real-life dice throw, ideal for making decisions on the go.
- **Adaptive UI Elements:** Utilization of Expanded widgets ensures the app is responsive to various screen sizes.

## Skills and Concepts Acquired

- Mastering the use of Stateless Widgets for UI design.
- Implementing Stateful Widgets to dynamically update the UI.
- Modifying widget properties for customized app experiences.
- Employing onPressed listeners for button interaction.
- Applying setState to refresh the UI efficiently.
- Adapting UI components with Expanded for responsive design.
- Integrating string interpolation for dynamic text display.
- Grasping basic Dart programming concepts, including data types and functions.
- Implementing gesture controls for an interactive user experience.

This project was important in understanding the core aspects of Flutter app development, particularly in creating interactive and responsive UI components.
